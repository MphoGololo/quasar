In this test case,
we try to generate the space of all possible cache-variables from the following
variables:
- scalars and arrays: both
- initializers from configuration as well as using valueAndStatus
- all known quasar data types, restricting to legal combinations (for example,
  arrays are not legal in valueAndStatus)
- with forbidden write as well as with write delegates

There is one class (TestClass) with Device Logic.
